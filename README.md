# My work

## Project Aincrad and Argus

In March of 2021 I started developing a fan project using VRChat's [Unity SDK](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/guides/getting-started/) based on my lifelong favorite anime: Sword Art Online (SAO). The core idea of the project was to pay closer attention to the details that most other developers often took liberties on in their own SAO projects. To make the endeavor that much harder, I immediately identified that the very first hurdle for me to get over was rewriting the networking code for item interactions, as there was not enough networking headroom for the slew of other features needed to make this project come to life.

One day, while receiving help on a Discord server I frequented, I met a very talented programmer named [@BocuD](https://github.com/BocuD) who joined me in developing the project. As time went on and the project's success and scope continued to grow, Bocu and I realized the project would similarly continue to outgrow its small team, so we formed an official application page and established a payment system to distribute Patreon funds evenly based on each member's contributions each month. We named ourselves Argus, and are in the process of reviewing the perks/drawbacks of establishing an official business out of our team.
