# My work

## Project Aincrad and Argus

In March of 2021 I started developing a fan project using VRChat's [Unity SDK](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/guides/getting-started/) based on my lifelong favorite anime: Sword Art Online (SAO) titled 'Project Aincrad' (PA). The core idea of PA was to pay closer attention to the details that most other developers often took liberties on in their own SAO projects. To make the endeavor that much harder, I immediately identified that the very first hurdle for me to get over was rewriting the networking code for item interactions, as there was not enough networking headroom for the slew of other features needed to make this project come to life. One day, while receiving help on a Discord server I frequented, I met a very talented programmer named [@BocuD](https://github.com/BocuD) who joined me in developing the project and provided great assistance in writing the complex networking code needed to support our game.

As time went on and the project's success and scope continued to grow, Bocu and I realized the project would similarly continue to outgrow its small team, so we formed an official application page and established a payment system to distribute Patreon funds evenly based on each member's contributions each month. We named ourselves Argus, and have began expanding our scope to games outside of Project Aincrad.

In June 2024 I decided that I wanted to pursue personal development, and left Argus. For more details on Argus and the work they are doing each day, check out their Discord at [Discord.gg/ArgusVRC](discord.gg/argusvrc)

## The Catacombs

In February 2023 I started developing a VR game using VRChat's [Unity SDK](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/guides/getting-started/) based on an original idea where players perform apothecary and alchemical work, and explore Catacombs thematically matching [Seattle Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Underground). This project being an original idea, I've had the chance to explore my own creativity while rapidly prototyping throughout the month of March. In November 2023, I officially released the project as a Demo, and I plan to continue development on it in the future.

In March 2024 I started a new project.
